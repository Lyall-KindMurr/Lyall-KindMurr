### Name's Lyall Kindmurr.

A videogame development graduate, with broad experience in the field, aptitudes in Unity and usage of 3D models and texturing techniques. 

Projects featured on this Git are likely version control to help me from not dying inside, as im used to working from multiple devices (don't get me started on how much 2FA screams at me for this.)
At the moment of writing this, none of the projects are massively active, and some repos are still from the days of university, but ideally some cancelled game prototypes will start surfacing on this page.
